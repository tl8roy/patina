# Patina

Based on the Oxdize talk by Tristan Lostroh, this repo will track the issues and assest required to bring Embedded Rust to hobbiest electronic engineers

Context: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XJdM1ZhFA2RbumnIgHLvUFZNUB2PGNtzoQEsGe5a-Q0/edit?usp=sharing

## Goals

The primary goal is to have tools and documentation that provides the best experience to a beginner to embedded Rust.

## Current Tasks

- Work with the exsiting Rust Hierarchy to ensure that Patina has the correct structure and governance
- Update and maintain the existing documentation
- Create and maintain a "one stop shop" of high quality guides and tutorials
- Expand the number of embedded hal traits
- Assist with efforts to improve VS Code to allow a lower entry bar
- Work to develop and support a specific hardware project to allow focused guides and tutorials
