# Patina

Based on the Oxdize talk by Tristan Lostroh, this repo will track the issues and assest required to bring Embedded Rust to hobbiest electronic engineers

## Goals

The primary goal is to have tools and documentation that provides the best experience to a beginner to embedded Rust.

## How can I help

### I want to help with tooling and IDE support

Check out [probe-rs](https://probe.rs/) for general Embedded Tooling. Their current plans will likely get Embedded Rust to where Patina needs it.
If you are interested in better debugging, look at [Knurling](https://github.com/knurling-rs/meta)

### I want to help with Intermediate and Advanced Guides or structured learning 

[Knurling](https://github.com/knurling-rs/meta) is the open source outreach of (Ferrous Systems)[https://ferrous-systems.com]. This program will greatly expand the amount of high quality guides and courses avaiable.

### I want to help with the reference material

[Awesome Rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust) and [Awesome Embedded Rust](https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust) are the current goto places for high quality content.

Both these resources however need to be kept up to date and relavant. Awesome Embedded Rust specifically could use some work with more device crates linked as well as more tutorials. Create your own adventure and link to it here!

### I want to help with the organisation of the Patina project

We are still in benovolant dictator mode. It would be great for the project to be able to exist on its own or integrated into the wider Rust organisation. Please leave your suggestion in this [issue](https://github.com/tl8roy/patina/issues/8)

## Current Tasks

- Work with the exsiting Rust Hierarchy to ensure that Patina has the correct structure and governance
- Update and maintain the existing documentation
- Create and maintain a "one stop shop" of high quality guides and tutorials
- Expand the number of embedded hal traits
- Assist with efforts to improve VS Code to allow a lower entry bar
- Work to develop and support a specific hardware project to allow focused guides and tutorials

Please feel free to add to this project via issues or pull requests
